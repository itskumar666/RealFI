🏠 RealEstateFi – Tokenized Real Estate + DeFi Lending Protocol
Build real-world wealth on the blockchain.

RealEstateFi is a decentralized platform where verified land/property owners can tokenize their property, earn rewards based on property value, and access lending without intermediaries. It combines real estate, DeFi, and on-chain governance to create a secure, transparent, and trust-minimized protocol.

🚀 Features
✅ Property NFT Verification – On-chain registry of land backed by KYC/KYB & off-chain document verification.

📦 Fractional Ownership – ERC-20 tokens representing fractional shares of the property.

💰 Reward Token (YIELD) – Daily minting based on real estate appreciation using oracles.

🏦 Lending System – Use verified tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins.

🗳 Governance – Reward token holders vote on listings, rules, and emissions.
